        <dc:title>Biomarker Ontology (BMONT)</dc:title>
        <terms:description>The Biomarker Ontology (BMONT) is a comprehensive knowledge representation involving a variety of fields of medical and biological aspects. BMONT is built in line with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) principles.
Entities and definitions are added by reviewing the old biomarker terminology that was created by Fraunhofer SCAI 10 years ago  and was used for mining biomarker information in biomedical literature. In addition, related terms were collected from scientific publications and books capturing various disease fields. 

The ontology is proposed to be used for improving biomarker identification tasks, as well as a supportive integratable tool for abundant AI techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Large Learning Model (LLM).</terms:description>

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: &apos;Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions&apos;  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can&apos;t be evaluated by those criteria.

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don&apos;t have definitions of &apos;meaning&apos; or &apos;expression&apos; or &apos;property&apos;. For &apos;reference&apos; in the intended sense I think we use the term &apos;denotation&apos;. For &apos;expression&apos;, I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For &apos;meaning&apos; it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let&apos;s the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let&apos;s the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The &apos;intended reader&apos; part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition.

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable.

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.  </obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116 xml:lang="en">BFO 2 Reference: The realm of occurrents is less pervasively marked by the presence of natural units than is the case in the realm of independent continuants. Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)</obo:IAO_0000116>

(These terms are all, in the jargon of philosophy, phase sortals.) By using role terms in definitions, we can create a BFO conformant treatment of such entities drawing on the fact that, while an instance of professor may be simultaneously an instance of trade union member, no instance of the type professor role is also (at any time) an instance of the type trade union member role (any more than any instance of the type color is at any time an instance of the type length).If an ontology of employment positions should be defined in terms of roles following the above pattern, this enables the ontology to do justice to the fact that individuals instantiate the corresponding universals –  professor, sergeant, nurse – only during certain phases in their lives.</obo:IAO_0000116>

However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses. It does, however, show that the examples in question need to be addressed carefully in order to show how they can be fitted into the proposed scheme, for example by recognizing additional subdivisions [29</obo:IAO_0000112>

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116 xml:lang="en">BFO 2 Reference: Each object is such that there are entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its interior, and other entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its exterior. This may not be so for entities lying at or near the boundary between the interior and exterior. This means that two objects – for example the two cells depicted in Figure 3 – may be such that there are material entities crossing their boundaries which belong determinately to neither cell. Something similar obtains in certain cases of conjoined twins (see below).</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116 xml:lang="en">BFO 2 Reference: To say that b is causally unified means: b is a material entity which is such that its material parts are tied together in such a way that, in environments typical for entities of the type in question,if c, a continuant part of b that is in the interior of b at t, is larger than a certain threshold size (which will be determined differently from case to case, depending on factors such as porosity of external cover) and is moved in space to be at t at a location on the exterior of the spatial region that had been occupied by b at t, then either b’s other parts will be moved in coordinated fashion or b will be damaged (be affected, for example, by breakage or tearing) in the interval between t and t.causal changes in one part of b can have consequences for other parts of b without the mediation of any entity that lies on the exterior of b. Material entities with no proper material parts would satisfy these conditions trivially. Candidate examples of types of causal unity for material entities of more complex sorts are as follows (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list):CU1: Causal unity via physical coveringHere the parts in the interior of the unified entity are combined together causally through a common membrane or other physical covering\. The latter points outwards toward and may serve a protective function in relation to what lies on the exterior of the entity [13, 47</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116 xml:lang="en">BFO 2 Reference: In BFO 1.1 the assumption was made that the external surface of a material entity such as a cell could be treated as if it were a boundary in the mathematical sense. The new document propounds the view that when we talk about external surfaces of material objects in this way then we are talking about something fiat. To be dealt with in a future version: fiat boundaries at different levels of granularity.More generally, the focus in discussion of boundaries in BFO 2.0 is now on fiat boundaries, which means: boundaries for which there is no assumption that they coincide with physical discontinuities. The ontology of boundaries becomes more closely allied with the ontology of regions.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000112 xml:lang="en">On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000112 xml:lang="en">One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000112 xml:lang="en">The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.</obo:IAO_0000112>

It provides recommendations to sponsors and FDA reviewers in preparing and reviewing premarket approval applications (PMA) and premarket notification (510(k)) submissions for pharmacogenetic and other human genetic tests, whether testing is for single markers or for multiple markers simultaneously (multiplex tests). Array-based tests (commonly referred to as microarrays) are a subset of multiplex tests and are included in the scope of this document. The recommendations within this guidance for elements of a genetic test submission apply to pharmacogenetic (e.g., drug-metabolizing enzyme allele tests, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis) and other types of genetic tests. Tests of gene expression and tests for non-heritable (somatic) mutations are not specifically addressed, although many of the same principles may apply. In addition, this guidance considers nucleic acid-based analysis only, but the principles may be applied to other matrices (e.g., protein) when the purpose is to provide genetic information.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a metric derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used to study the microstructural organization of tissues, particularly white matter in the brain. FA quantifies the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion within tissue. In white matter, water molecules tend to diffuse more easily along the direction of the fiber tracts (axonal bundles) than perpendicular to them. FA values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater directionality or organization of the tissue microstructure, typically reflecting intact white matter tracts.</obo:IAO_0000115>

In neuroimaging, techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligands targeting tau can visualize and quantify tau deposition in the brain. These imaging methods enable researchers and clinicians to detect the presence of abnormal tau aggregates and assess their distribution and severity.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>An insulin that is produced in the pancreas and involved in regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates (particularly glucose) and fats. Commonly thought of as a protein, it consists of two peptide chains, one containing 21 amino acid residues and the other containing 30; the chains are joined together by 2 disulfide bonds. Recombinant insulin is identical to human insulin, but is synthesised by inserting the human insulin gene into E. coli, which then produces insulin for human use. It is used in the treatment of type I and type II diabetes.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <rdfs:comment>A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a pathological bodily process that occurs after a medical intervention. An adverse event is likely caused by the medical intervention; however, such a causal association is not required to be an adverse event.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>Melanie Courtot and YH: More work is needed on how to restrict the scope of a term to be an &apos;adverse event&apos;, notably regarding temporal association. When is an appropirate time interval between a medical intervention and an adverse event observed? One week, one month, one year, or a lifetime? For some well-studied medical interventions (e.g., administration of many vaccines or drugs), we probably have a general idea. For many new interventions, we don&apos;t know much. In OAE, this issue is associated with defining the &apos;adverse event incubation time&apos;.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: An adverse event is a process that has specified output of some adverse medical outcome (e.g., symptom, sign or accident) after a medical intervention (or process) (e.g., administration of drug or vaccine). The medical intervention can be an administration of a drug, a vaccine (i.e., vaccination), or a special nutritional product (for example, dietary supplement, infant formula, medical food), surgery, or usage of a medical device.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: An adverse event is possibly induced by the medical intervention. It can be caused by the medical intervention, or may not be caused by the medical intervention. One ultimate goal (or the goal in clinics) of study adverse events is to assess if the adverse event outcome is due to the medical intervention.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: In development of OAE, we initially use vaccine adverse event as our use case. A vaccine adverse event is associated with a vaccination (i.e. a medical intervention), regardless of whether it is considered vaccine-related, and includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction or significant failure of immunization (i.e., a pharmacologic action).
Ref: Baylor NW and Midthum K. Regulation and testing of vaccines. In: Vaccines (Editors: Plotkin S, Orenstein W, and Offit P). 2008.  p1623.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: The current term &apos;adverse event&apos; is different from the term definition shown in our paper: He Y, Xiang Z, Sarntivijai S, Toldo L, Ceusters W. OAE: a realism-based biomedical ontology for the representation of adverse events. Adverse Event Representation Workshop, International Conference on Biomedical Ontologies (ICBO), University at Buffalo, NY, July 26-30, 2011. Full lenghth conference proceeding paper.  

We  made the name changing in order to make OAE cover the broader sense of the &apos;adverse event&apos; which does not assume definite causal effect between an adverse event and a medical intervention. In current definition, the adverse event emphasizes the time association and assumes a likelihood of such a causal association. This term &apos;adverse event&apos; is stil under the OGMS:pathological bodily process.

The &apos;adverse event&apos; defined in the above paper has now been changed to a new term: &apos;causal adverse event&apos;.

        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: The main scope of OAE includes: (1) represent terms and relations in the area of adverse events, (2) assess possible associations between an adverse event and a medical intervention, particularly, identify any causal effect of a medical intervention to an adverse event; and (2) understand the mechanism (including molecular mechanisms) of causal adverse events.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>YH: There has been discussion regarding whether the term &apos;side effect&apos; is an alternative term for &apos;adverse event&apos;. In AERO, the term &apos;AERO:adverse event&apos; represents a subset of those adverse events for which causality has been established. In OAE, an adverse event for which causality has been established is called &apos;causal adverse event&apos;.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of &quot;device&quot;, and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>Relational qualities are qualities that hold between multiple entities. Normal (monadic) qualities such as the shape of a eyeball exist purely as a quality of that eyeball. A relational quality such as sensitivity to light is a quality of that eyeball (and connecting nervous system) as it relates to incoming light waves/particles.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The definition above excludes protein complexes, which some also consider a protein. Those who wish to refer to a class representing both senses of the word are directed to CHEBI:36080. Note that the definition allows for experimentally-manipulated genes, and allows for artifically-produced derivatives that mimic those found naturally. Proteins (in the sense defined here) that descended from a common ancestor can be classified into families and superfamilies composed of products of evolutionarily-related genes. The domain architecture of a protein is described by the order of its constituent domains. Proteins with the same domains in the same order are defined as homeomorphic [PRO:WCB].</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:UBPROP_0000003>In vertebrates, at early stages of Central Nervous System (CNS) development, the architecture of the brain primordium reveals the presence of the cavity of brain vesicles, which is filled by Embryonic Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (E-CSF). (...) Rat and chick E-CSF proteomes are similar, although rat is more complex in certain groups of proteins, e.g., apolipoproteins, which may be involved in the control of neural diversity, and has soluble enzymes present, just like adult human CSF, but unlike chick E-CSF, revealing phylogenetic brain differences between these groups of vertebrates.[uncertain][VHOG]</obo:UBPROP_0000003>
        <obo:UBPROP_0000012>EHDAA2 models this as developing from CP, which is wrong</obo:UBPROP_0000012>
        <obo:UBPROP_0000012>the FMA def states that this is subarachnoid spaces only. ZFA def states subarachnoid spaces and brain ventricles, but not SC (and has part_of to brain). Circulation: It circulates from the lateral ventricles to the foramen of Monro (Interventricular foramen), third ventricle, aqueduct of Sylvius (Cerebral aqueduct), fourth ventricle, foramen of Magendie (Median aperture) and foramina of Luschka (Lateral apertures), subarachnoid space over brain and spinal cord. It should be noted that the CSF moves in a pulsatile manner throughout the CSF system with nearly zero net flow. CSF is reabsorbed into venous sinus blood via arachnoid granulations.</obo:UBPROP_0000012>

        <obo:UBPROP_0000008>We classify a wide variety of not necessarily homologous fluids here. In humans, the saliva is a turbid and slightly viscous fluid, generally of an alkaline reaction, and is secreted by the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands. In the mouth the saliva is mixed with the secretion from the buccal glands. In man and many animals, saliva is an important digestive fluid on account of the presence of the peculiar enzyme, ptyalin</obo:UBPROP_0000008>

        <obo:UBPROP_0000008>An organ sometimes referred to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate Amphioxus. However, this is an enzyme secreting gland, not a metabolic organ, and it is unclear how truly homologous it is to the vertebrate liver. The zebrafish liver differs from the mammalian liver in that the hepatocytes are not clearly organized in cords or lobules and the typical portal triads are not apparent. In addition, the zebrafish liver does not have Kuppfer cells. Furthermore, a clear distinction can be made between the male and female liver in the adult zebrafish. The female hepatocytes are very basophilic (Figure 15c) as a result of the production of vitellogenin (Van der Ven et al. 2003).</obo:UBPROP_0000008>
        <obo:UBPROP_0000008>The liver is found in all vertebrates, and is typically the largest visceral organ. Its form varies considerably in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs. Nonetheless, in most species it is divided into right and left lobes; exceptions to this general rule include snakes, where the shape of the body necessitates a simple cigar-like form. The internal structure of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates.</obo:UBPROP_0000008>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues when blood circulation is inadequate. Serum concentration of VEGF is high in bronchial asthma and low in diabetes mellitus. VEGF&apos;s normal function is to create new blood vessels during embryonic development, new blood vessels after injury, muscle following exercise, and new vessels (collateral circulation) to bypass blocked vessels.
When VEGF is overexpressed, it can contribute to disease. Solid cancers cannot grow beyond a limited size without an adequate blood supply; cancers that can express VEGF are able to grow and metastasize. Overexpression of VEGF can cause vascular disease in the retina of the eye and other parts of the body. Drugs such as bevacizumab can inhibit VEGF and control or slow those diseases.
VEGF is a sub-family of growth factors, to be specific, the platelet-derived growth factor family of cystine-knot growth factors. They are important signaling proteins involved in both vasculogenesis (the de novo formation of the embryonic circulatory system) and angiogenesis (the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature).</obo:IAO_0000115>

The serum level of calcium is closely regulated within a fairly limited range in the human body. In a healthy physiology, extracellular calcium levels are maintained within a tight range through the actions of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and the calcium sensing receptor.[1] Disorders in calcium metabolism can lead to hypocalcemia, decreased plasma levels of calcium or hypercalcemia, elevated plasma calcium levels.</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>In vascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly defined as an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by (or acting on) the endothelium. Normal functions of endothelial cells include mediation of coagulation, platelet adhesion, immune function and control of volume and electrolyte content of the intravascular and extravascular spaces.</obo:IAO_0000115>
